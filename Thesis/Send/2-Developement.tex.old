\section{Calabi-Yau motivation}

In the following section we motivate the requirement that additional dimensions are compactified
over a Calabi-Yau manifold (a compact complex manifold of $SU(3)$ holonomy).

We assume that the manifold $\mathcal M$ is factorizable into a four-dimensional maximally symmetric space-time $T$ and a six-dimensional compact space $K$,
$\mathcal M =  T\times K$.

Out of all the possible ways to compactify a theory, we pick out those that preserve some
degree of supersymmetry.
%There are several reasons for this choice:
%\begin{itemize}
%%  \item Gauge hierarchy problem.
%%    \todoin{Is it relevant today?}
%  \item As a way to solve the equations of motion.
%    \todoin{What does this mean? A SUSY configurations satisfies the eom -> SUGRA. Classically?}
%  \item It gives a nice phenomenological description.
%
%    A four dimensional theory with $\mathcal N=1$ supersymmetry allows for massless fermions
%    that transform in a complex representation of the gauge group associated to the supersymmetry.
%    Since $\mathcal N\geq 2$ in four dimensions all fermions must transform in a real representation 
%    of the gauge group, we shall only consider the case $\mathcal N=1$.
%
%    \todoin{Understand the reason for different possible representations.}
%    \todoin{Does this mean that at higher energies there are no chiral fermions?}
%\end{itemize}
Our main reason for this choice is that they provide a nice way to obtain realistic particle 
physics models. 
In particular, we will see that an $\mathcal N=1$ supersymmetric theory allows for chiral fermions.
In addition, supersymmetric configurations are easier to study before tackling more general compactifications.

An approach to construct a supersymmetric theory is roughly to extend the Poincaré algebra adding supersymmetry generators which satisfy specific 
anti-commutation relations, instead of commutation relatios. 
The anti-commutaion relations are of the type
\begin{equation}
  \{ Q_\alpha, Q_\beta\} = \{\bar Q_\alpha,\bar Q_\beta\} = 0, \qquad \{Q_\alpha, \bar Q_\beta\}\sim \sigma_{\alpha\beta}^\mu P_\mu
\end{equation}

A finite SUSY transformation is obtained exponentiating the generators
\begin{equation}
  e^{i(\eta Q+ \bar \eta \bar Q - x_\mu P^\mu)}
\end{equation}


Every supersymmetry transformation is parametrized by an infinitesimal parameter $\eta_\alpha (X)$,
so that 
\begin{equation}
  \delta \ket{boson} = \ket{fermion} 
\end{equation}
\todoin{Clarify transformation. Do we need to introduce superspace to introduce $\eta$?}
%\todoin{Insert definition of $\eta$. Is it a Grassmann variable, a spinor, an operator\ldots}
%which is anti-commuting, two-component Weyl fermion that has an associated conserved supercharge $Q$ at every space-time point.

A conserved charge $Q$ associated to an unbroken supersymmetry annihilates the vacuum $\ket{\Omega}$,
so $Q\ket{\Omega}=0$.
This in turn means that for any operator $U$, $\ev{ \{Q,U\} }{\Omega}=0$.
%\begin{equation}
%  U' = U+\delta U = e^{-iQ\eta} U e^{iQ\eta} = (1 + iQ\eta) U (1- iQ\eta) = \cdots
%\end{equation}
If $U$ is a fermionic operator, we derive that the variation of the operator under the supersymmetry
transformation is $\delta U = \{ Q, U\}$.
Taking this as the classical limit, $\delta U = \ev{\delta U}{\Omega}$.
Thus, we conclude that at the classical level $\delta U = 0$ for any fermionic field $U$.

The low-energy theory of the ten-dimensional type IIA string theory is type IIA SUGRA, which although it has
$\mathcal N=2$ instead of $\mathcal N=1$, we will see a workaround. 
The type IIA string theory has as NS-NS fields the dilaton $\phi$, the metric $G$ and the two-form field $B$.
In the RR sector we have the one-form and three-form, $c_1$ and $c_3$.
For convenience, we define employ the democratic formulation
\todoin{Understand democratic formulation. We add new degrees of freedom $c_5,c_7,c_9$ but impose
self-duality $c_7=\star c_3$, $c_9=\star c_1$?}
We also define the field strength of the NS form $H=dB$ and the $F^{10)}$ as the formal sum
\begin{equation}
  F^{10)}=dC-H\wedge C+me^B
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the formal sum of odd differential form fields.
\todoin{$F^{10)}$ is not a true differential form. What is m?}
\todoin{What is the relation between $F^{10)}$ and $F^{10)}_n$}
\begin{equation}
  F^{10)}_n = (-1)^{\floor{n/2}}\star F^{10)}_{10-n}
\end{equation}

Type IIA SUGRA has as elementary fermions two Majora-Weyl gravitinos of the same chirality $\psi_M$ and two dilatinos $\lambda$. 
Their variation under a supersymmetry transformation is
\begin{equation}
    \delta \psi_M = D_M \eta + \frac{1}{4}\slashed H_M \Gamma_{11} \eta + \frac{1}{16}e^\phi \sum_n \slashed F^{10)}_n \Gamma_M \Gamma_{11}^{n/2)} \sigma^1 \eta
\end{equation}

%\todoin{Should I explain cov. der.?}
Where $\slashed{F}_n^{10)} = \frac{1}{n!}F_{P_1\ldots P_N}\Gamma^{P_1\ldots P_N}$,
$\slashed H_M= \frac{1}{2} H_{MNP} \Gamma^{NP}$, $\Gamma_{P_1\ldots P_N}=\Gamma_{[P_1}\ldots\Gamma_{P_N]}$ 
and 
\todoin{
  the Dirac matrices for the ten-dimensional space time are
  $\Gamma^M = e^M_A \Gamma^A$.
  Here $e^M_A$ denotes the vielbein that describes the graviton which is related to the metric through $G_{\mu\nu}=e^a_\mu e^b_\nu \eta_{ab}$ 
  and $\Gamma^A$ are elements of a Clifford algebra, so $\{\Gamma^A,\Gamma^B\}=2\eta^{AB}$. 
  What is $\Gamma^{n/2)}$ and how can $\sigma^1$ act on $\eta$?
}

Supersymmetry preservation means that all variations must be zero. 
For convenience, we set $H=0$ and $\phi=\mathrm{const.}$ .
This leads to the constraint that $\eta$ is a covariantly constant spinor
\begin{equation}
  \delta \psi_M = D_M \eta = 0
%  \delta \xi^a &= -\frac{1}{4g\sqrt \phi} \Gamma^{MN} F^a_{MN} \eta 
\end{equation}

The equation implies that there exists a spinor $\eta$ such that  $[D_M,D_N]\eta=R_{MNPQ} \Gamma^{PQ} \eta=0$.
If we particularize to the four-dimensional space-time  $T$, which is a maximally symmetric space, the last equation imposes that
$T$ is Minkowski space.%, which is not surprising.
%\todoin{Cosmological constant blah, blah, blah.}
We thus conclude that $\eta$ does not depend on the uncompactified 
coordinates,  $\partial_T \eta=0$.

%\todoin{\url{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.physics.research/rrBoIXk9Rw0}}
We proceed to examine what the existence of a covariantly constant spinor field imposes on the compact space. 

Let us consider a Riemannian manifold $K$ of dimension $n$ with a spin connection $\omega$, which 
is in general a $SO(n)$ gauge field.
If we parallel transport a field $\psi$ around a contractible closed curve $\gamma$, the field becomes
$U\psi$ where $U=\mathcal P e^{\int_\gamma dx \omega}$ and $\mathcal P$ denotes the path ordering of 
the exponential.
The set of transformation matrices associated to all possible loops form the holonomy group of the manifold, 
which must be a subgroup of $SO(n)$.

A covariantly constant spinor is left unchanged when paralleled transported along a contractible
closed curve, so the holonomy matrices of a manifold that admits a covariantly constant spinor 
must satisfy $U\eta = \eta$, which in our case $U$ belongs to a subgroup of $SO(6)$.
Taking into account the Lie algebra isomorphism $\mathfrak{so}(6)\simeq \mathfrak{su}(4)$ we identify the positive
(negative)-chirality spinors of $SO(6)$ with the fundamental $\mathbf 4$ ($\mathbf {\bar 4}$)
of $SU(4)$.
Let us take that $\eta$ is a positive chirality spinor, so it transforms according with the 
$\mathbf 4$ of $SU(4)$.
Then, $\eta$ is left invariant under $SU(3)$ transformations and can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \eta= 
  \qty(
  \begin{array}{c}
    0\\
    0\\
    0\\
    \eta_0
  \end{array}
  )
\end{equation}
In other words, the existence of a covariantly constant spinor implies that the holonomy group 
of the manifold is $SU(3)$.
%\todoin{I ommit why it can't be other subgroup.}

We now give the definition of Calabi-Yau manifold as a compact manifold with local holonomy group $SU(3)$.
\todoin{Local or global holonomy?}

\subsection{U(3) holonomy implies complex manifold}

We will introduce one of the properties of a Calabi-Yau manifold, that it is a complex manifold.

The only  $U(3)$ invariants in the $\mathbf{6}$ representation of $SO(6)$ are the identity and
$\bar I$.

%\todoin{Check the different spaces we consider.}
We can also form a tensor field on $K$ of the type $J^i_j(y)=g^{ik}(y) \bar\eta \Lambda_{kj} \eta(y)$.
For each point $y$, we can consider $J^i_j$ as a matrix that acts on the tangent space, so $v^i \to J^i_j v^j$.
In this sense, $J^i_j$ is a real, traceless and $SU(3)$ invariant matrix, which means that it must be proportional
to $\bar I$.
We had already seen that $\bar I = -I$, this an example of an almost-complex structure, which is 
a tensor field $J$ that satisfies $J^2=-I$.

If we employ complex coordinates, we can diagonalize $J$ so that the non-zero components are
$J^a_b=i\delta^a_b$ and $J^{\bar a}_{\bar b}=-i\delta^{\bar a}_{\bar b}$. This particular choice
is know as the canonical form.

It is always possible to choose particular coordinates to bring $J$ to the canonical form at a particular 
point.
But in general, the canonical form will not hold at an open neighborhood of a point.
If a manifold admits a set of coordinates (called local holomorphic coordinates) such that at every
point, the canonical form holds for an open neighborhood, then the almost complex structure is integrable.

The necessary and sufficient condition for integrability is that the Nijenhuis tensor

\begin{equation}
  N^k_{ij}= J^l_i(\partial_l J^k_j - \partial_j J^k_l) - J_j^l (\partial_l J^k_i - \partial_i J^k_l)
\end{equation}

vanishes.
An integrable almost-complex structure is a complex structure and a manifold with a complex structure
is a complex manifold.

%where $\Omega$ is the worldsheet parity and $\mathcal R$ is a particular $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry.

%\subsection{D6-branes in flat 10d space}
%
%We have seen that if we compactify an heterotic string theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold, we obtain
%$\mathcal N=1$ which allows chirality. 
%This is not the case of Type II theories, which lead to $\mathcal N=2$.
%In order to reduce the degree of supersymmetry and thus obtain chiral 4d fermions, two D6-branes in flat 10d can intersect over a 4d region.
%Before considering D6-branes over a Calabi-Yau compactification, we consider the flat space
%case.
%
%The open string spectrum of an intersection of a stack of $N_1$ D6-branes and a stack of $N_2$ D6-branes
%can be classified as:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Strings stretching from one stack to itself, which lead to 7d $U(N_i)$ gauge bosons, three real
%    adjoint scalars and their fermion superpartners, .
%  \item String that go from one stack to the other are localized at the intersection. 
%    Their associated fields are charged under the bi-fundamental representation $(N_1, \bar N_2)$ of 
%    $U(N_1)\times U(N_2)$, which includes a 4d chiral fermion in $(N_1,\bar N_2)$.
