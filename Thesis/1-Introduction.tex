\chapter{Type IIA generalities}

The are six main types of strings theories: a bosonic string theory and five supersymmetric 
string theories, the latter include both bosons and fermions.
%While the bosonic string theory can be formulated solely using closed strings, superstring theories
%require closed and open strings.
In this thesis we will only work with the supersymmetric type IIA theory. 

\subsection{TIIA spectrum}
Type IIA string theory requires ten space-time dimensions to be consistent.
Furthermore, it has a 10-dimensional supersymmetry with 32 supercharges, which corresponds to $\mathcal N=(1,1)$.
The flat 10-dimensional space-time bosonic spectrum of type IIA can be classified according to
the boundary conditions of the strings, whether we consider Ramond (R) or Neveu–Schwarz (NS) conditions.
In the NS-NS sector, we have the dilaton $\phi$, a two-form $B_2$ and a graviton $G_{\mu\nu}$,
while in the R-R sector we have the 1- and 3-forms $c_1, c_3$.
The fermions, which belong to the NS-R and R-NS sectors, are two opposite-chirality gravitinos $\psi$ and two opposite-chirality dilatinos $\lambda$.
%This is the perturbative spectrum around the vacuum, which is made of closed strings only. 

\subsection{The D-brane}

A generalization of strings are D$p$-branes, which are $p$-dimensional extended objects.
Thus, a D$1$-brane would correspond to a string, a D$2$-brane would be a membrane and so on.
The existence of D$p$-branes can be motivated, in the weak coupling limit, as 
objects where open strings end, so they are a way to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on open strings.
In fact, D-branes should be though as new non-perturbative states in their own right.
\todoin{Might remove last line. More subtle than this. In perturbative regime branes are fully described in terms of strings. f-strings, T and S dualities 
lead to a more democratic formulation in non-perturbative regime.}

We can study the dynamics of a D$p$-branes in terms of the dynamics of open strings with endpoints
attached to the D$p$-brane.
Let us consider the open string excitations of a D$p$-brane, the latter spanning $p+1$ dimensions and transverse to $d-p-1$ dimensions.
The presence of the D$p$-brane breaks the ten-dimensional Poincaré invariance of the theory, because
particles propagate on the $(p+1)$-dimensional volume of the D$p$-brane only.
This implies that massless particles must transform under irreducible representations of $SO(p-2)$, instead of
$SO(d-2)$.
The massless spectrum in $(p+1)$ dimensions of the open string theory is composed by a gauge boson $A^\mu$ ($\mu=0,\ldots,p$) (corresponding
to transverse oscillations to the brane),
$9-p$ real scalars $\phi^i$ (corresponding to longitudinal oscillations to the brane) and some fermions $\lambda_a$.
This particle content can be arranged into a vector supermultiplet of $U(1)$ with $16$ supersymmetries
in $(p+1)$ dimensions. 
Thus, a D$p$-brane reduces the degree of supersymmetry of the type IIA theory by half.

In order to find out the action of a D$p$-brane we must realize that it corresponds to the
$(p+1)$-dimensional effective action of the massless open string excitations of the D$p$-brane.
As an illustration of this, a D$p$-brane breaks the translational symmetry of the vacuum, which allows
us to conclude that the $\phi^i$ scalar fields are the Goldstone bosons associated to the broken symmetry. 
The vev of these scalar fields determine the position of the D$p$-brane in the transverse space, and the fluctuations of the scalar
fields determine the evolution of the D$p$-brane wordlvolume $W_{p+1}$ (the worldline of a particle generalization to the case of branes). 
The resulting action of the bosonic sector of the D$p$-brane is the sum of a Dirac-Born-Infeld term $S_{DBI}$ and a Chern-Simons term $S_{CS}$.

The DBI term carries the information of how a D$p$-brane interacts with the NSNS fields. 
It takes the form

\begin{equation}
  S_{DBI}= -\frac{\alpha'^{-(p+1)/2}}{(2\pi)^p}\int_{W_{p+1}}  d^{p+1}x f(\phi^i, A^\mu, G_{\mu\nu}, B_2, \phi)
\end{equation}

where the precise expression of $f$ is unimportant for the purposes of this work.
\todoin{What is the background here and what is dynamical? BG: closed string fields and Dynamical: open string fields?}

%\begin{equation}
%  S_{DBI}= -\frac{\alpha'^{-(p+1)/2}}{(2\pi)^p} \int d^{p+1} x e^{-\phi} \sqrt{-\det(P\qty[G+B]-2\pi \alpha'F)}
%\end{equation}
%
%gauge field strength $F=d $
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \mu_p = \frac{(\alpha')^{-(p+1)/2}}{(2\pi)^p}
%\end{equation}
%
%pullback

If we expand the DBI action in powers of $\alpha'$, we obtain the Yang-Mills term
\begin{equation}
  S_{YM} = \frac{\alpha'^{-(p-3)/2}}{4g_s (2\pi)^{p-2}} \int d^{p+1} x \sqrt {-g} \Tr F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
which allows us to identify the Yang-Mills coupling as 

\begin{equation}
g^2_{YM} = g_s \alpha'^{(p-3)/2}(2\pi)^{p-2}
\end{equation}

The Chern-Simons term is topological in nature and describes how D$p$-branes interact with RR-fields.
%Which means that D$p$-branes are carry RR charge.
\todoin{Anything more to add?}

%\begin{equation}
%S_{CS}= \mu_p \int P[\sum_p c_q]\wedge e^{2\pi\alpha F_2 -B_2}\wedge \hat A (R)
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Multiple D-branes}

It is convenient to generalize the single D$p$-brane configuration to $N$ parallel D$p$-branes.
In order to determine the spectrum of a stack of D$p$-branes, we consider open strings with endpoints 
attached to either a single brane or two of them.

In the case of $N$ coincident D$p$-branes, all configurations lead to massless states, so the 
gauge symmetry is increased from $U(1)$ to $U(N)$.
The massless spectrum is composed of $(p-1)$-dimensional $U(n)$ gauge bosons, $(9-p)$ real
scalars in the adjoint representation and several fermions in the adjoint representation.

If all branes are separated from each other, strings that stretch from a brane to itself correspond to massless gauge bosons that belong to $U(1)^N$ .
In contrast, strings that stretch from one brane $A$ to another brane $B$ lead to massive particles whose
masses increases with the distance between branes.
The lightest of these particles have opposite have charge $(1,-1)$ under $U(1)_A \times U(1)_B$.
Since Type IIA strings carry an orientation, string that stretch from $B$ to $A$ would have opposite charges.

Let us now suppose D$p$-branes which are not parallel, so they can intersect each other.
This situation is relevant because in the case of D6-branes, it leads to 4-dimensional chiral fermions.
We are interested in describing the open string spectrum of two stacks of D$6$-branes that intersect over a 4-dimensional subspace of their volumes.

Strings that stretch from a coincident stack of $N$ D6-branes to itself lead to 7-dimensional $U(N)$ gauge bosons, three real adjoint scalars and their fermion superpartners.

String that stretch from a stack of $N_1$ D6-branes to another stack of $N_2$ D6-branes are localized at the intersection,
in order to minimize their energy. 
They lead to a 4-dimensional fermion charged in the $(\mathbf{N_1},\mathbf{N_2})$ of $U(N_1)\times U(N_2)$ or its conjugate, depending on the orientation
of the intersection.

Not all geometric configurations preserve supersymmetry. 
Let us decompose space-time as $M_4 \times \mathbb R^2 \times \mathbb R^2 \times \mathbb R^2 $.
The D6-branes span all $M_4$ and a line in each $\mathbb R^2$ plane, such that the angle between
two stacks is given by $\theta_i$ for each plane.
It can be shown that the condition $\theta_1\pm\theta_2\pm\theta_3=0 (\mathrm{mod} 2\pi)$ implies $\mathcal N=1$ 
supersymmetry in 4 dimensions, provided that no angle vanishes.
If some of the angles vanish, the supersymmetry would we enhanced.

The reason we have used D6-branes and no other dimension of D$p$-branes is that they would not lead to chiral fermions in 4 dimensions.
Intuitively, two D6-branes allow to define an orientation in the transverse 6-dimensional space, which would not be possible
with two other type of D$p$-branes.
\todoin{So have we seen that no Calabi-Yau is needed to obtain 4d chiral fermions if we consider a theory with intersecting 
D6-branes? Of course, we still would have to cancel RR charges in some way.}

\todoin{Add tadpole cancellation here?}

%\todoin{RR-sector -> RR-tadpole cancellation?}
%
%D6-branes acts as RR sources so 
%Cancellation of RR-tadpoles imply that the 4d effective theory is anomaly free.


\subsection{SUGRA}
 
The low-energy theory of the ten-dimensional type IIA string theory is type IIA SUGRA.
The spectrum of Type IIA SUGRA has as elementary fermions, which belong to the massless spectrum (NS-R and R-NS) of type IIA theory,
two Majorana-Weyl gravitinos of the same chirality $\psi_M^a$ and two dilatinos $\lambda^a$. 
\todoin{Isn't the spectrum the same as the high-energy TIIA? Might not need to mention SUGRA here then.}
