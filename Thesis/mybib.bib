abstract = {String theory is one of the most active branches of theoretical physics, and has the potential to provide a unified description of all known particles and interactions. This book is a systematic introduction to the subject, focused on the detailed description of how string theory is connected to the real world of particle physics. Aimed at graduate students and researchers working in high-energy physics, it provides explicit models of physics beyond the Standard Model. No prior knowledge of string theory is required as all necessary material is provided in the introductory chapters. The book pro-vides particle phenomenologists with the information needed to understand string theory model building, and describes in detail several alternative approaches to model build-ing, such as heterotic string compactifications, intersecting D-brane models, D-branes at singularities, and F-theory. LUIS E. IB{\'{A}}{\~{N}}EZ is Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Universidad Aut{\'{o}}noma de Madrid and member of the Instituto de F{\'{i}}sica Te{\'{o}}rica-UAM/CSIC. One of the world lead-ers in physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, he has made important contributions to the construction of the supersymmetric Standard Model and superstring phenomenology. ANGEL M. URANGA is Research Professor at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient{\'{i}}ficas at the Instituto de F{\'{i}}sica Te{\'{o}}rica-UAM/CSIC. He is one of the leading young string theorists working in the construction of models of particle physics, in particular due to his contribution on the use of D-branes to build realistic brane-world models.},

abstract = {We describe the general geometrical framework of brane world constructions in orientifolds of type IIA string theory with D6-branes wrapping 3-cycles in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and point out their immediate phenomenological relevance. These branes generically intersect in points, and the patterns of intersections govern the chiral fermion spectra and issues of gauge and supersymmetry breaking in the low energy effective gauge theory on their world volume. In particular, we provide an example of an intersecting brane world scenario on the quintic Calabi-Yau with the gauge group and the chiral spectrum of the Standard Model and discuss its properties in some detail. Additionally we explain related technical advancements in the construction of supersymmetric orientifold vacua with intersecting D-branes. Six-dimensional orientifolds of this type generalize the rather limited set of formerly known orbifolds of type I, and the presented techniques provide a short-cut to obtain their spectra. Finally, we comment on lifting configurations of intersecting D6-branes to M-theory on non-compact G{\_}2 manifolds.},

abstract = {We investigate orientifolds of type II string theory on K3 and Calabi-Yau 3-folds with intersecting D-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles. We determine quite generically the chiral massless spectrum in terms of topological invariants and discuss both orbifold examples and algebraic realizations in detail. Intriguingly, the developed techniques provide an elegant way to figure out the chiral sector of orientifold models without computing any explicit string partition function. As a new example we derive a non-supersymmetric Standard-like Model from an orientifold of type IIA on the quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold with wrapped D6-branes. In the case of supersymmetric intersecting brane models on Calabi-Yau manifolds we discuss the D-term and F-term potentials, the effective gauge couplings and the Green-Schwarz mechanism. The mirror symmetric formulation of this construction is provided within type IIB theory. We finally include a short discussion about the lift of these models from type IIB on K3 to F-theory and from type IIA on Calabi-Yau 3-folds to M-theory on G{\_}2 manifolds.},

@article{Candelas1991,
abstract = {We compute the prepotentials and the geometry of the moduli spaces for a Calabi-Yau manifold and its mirror. In this way we obtain all the sigma model corrections to the Yukawa couplings and moduli space metric for the original manifold. The moduli space is found to be subject to the action of a modular group which, among other operations, exchanges large and small values of the radius though the action on the radius is not as simple as R??? 1 R. It is shown also that the quantum corrections to the coupling decompose into a sum over instanton contributions and moreover that this sum converges. In particular there are no "sub-instanton" corrections. This sum over instantons points to a deep connection between the modular group and the rational curves of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The burden of the present work is that a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds is an exactly soluble superconformal theory, at least as far as the massless sector is concerned. Mirror pairs are also more general than exactly soluble models that have hitherto been discussed since we here solve the theory for all points of the moduli space. ?? 1991.},

We analyze the resulting four-dimensional effective theories, as well as some of its perturbative and non-perturbative corrections, focusing on moduli stabilization. Finally, we briefly review statistical studies of flux backgrounds. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},
