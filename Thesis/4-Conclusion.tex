\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

We have seen that D$6$-branes wrapping SLags three-cycles on Fermat's quintic present a serious obstruction
for model building, since they do allow a chiral spectrum.
Since the intersection number is a topological quantity, it is not expected to change under deformations.
In contrast, the volume of SLags does change, but it requires to calculate an integral which we do not 
now how to compute analytically.  
Thus, we have only obtained an estimate of how the volume varies under a particular deformation.
It would be interesting to discuss how the volume is affected by other deformations.

We encountered that deformations of the Fermat's quintic lead to singularities.
In a specific example  we obtain a conifold singularity, but generic deformations would require a detailed study of the type of singularities, possibly in terms of du Val singularities.
